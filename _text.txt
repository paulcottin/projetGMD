*FIELD* TX
A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that
absence of abdominal muscles with urinary tract abnormality and
cryptorchidism is caused by homozygous mutation in the CHRM3 gene
(118494) on chromosome 1q43. One such family has been reported.

DESCRIPTION

In its rare complete form, 'prune belly' syndrome comprises megacystis
(massively enlarged bladder) with disorganized detrusor muscle,
cryptorchidism, and thin abdominal musculature with overlying lax skin
(summary by Weber et al., 2011).

CLINICAL FEATURES

This condition was first described by Frolich (1839). The appellation
'prune belly syndrome' is descriptive because the intestinal pattern is
evident through the thin, lax, protruding abdominal wall in the infant
(Osler, 1901). (Osler did not use the term 'prune belly.' His article on
this subject and one 'on a family form of recurring epistaxis,
associated with multiple telangiectases of the skin and mucous
membranes'--see 187300--appeared successively in the November 1901 issue
of the Johns Hopkins Hospital Bulletin. Osler wrote: 'In the summer of
1897 a case of remarkable distension of the abdomen was admitted to the
wards, with greatly distended bladder, and on my return in September,
Dr. Futcher, knowing that I would be interested in it, sent for the
child.') The full syndrome probably occurs only in males (Williams and
Burkholder, 1967).

A possibly related syndrome was described in a single patient by Texter
and Murphy (1968). The triad consisted of absence of the right testis,
kidney, and rectus abdominis muscle.

King and Prescott (1978) presented evidence to support the suggestion
that the maldevelopment of the abdominal musculature and abdominal
laxity are secondary phenomena, the primary event being marked
distention of the abdomen in the fetal period because of obstruction of
the urinary tract. Likewise, Pagon et al. (1979) suggested that the
abdominal muscle deficiency is secondary to fetal abdominal distention
of various causes, most often perhaps, urethral obstruction with
enlarged bladder. 'Prune belly' occurs, in the main, as a consequence of
posterior urethral valves; thus the predominance as a male-limited
multifactorial trait.

Gaboardi et al. (1982) reported 2 brothers and a sister with prune belly
syndrome with bilateral hydronephrosis, megaureter, and megabladder, but
no urethral stenosis.

A better prognosis than is usually thought to obtain was suggested by
the series of 19 patients reported by Burke et al. (1969).

Greskovich and Nyberg (1988) gave a review in which they stated
incorrectly that the term prune belly syndrome was coined by Osler.

Dorst and Seidel (1982) suggested Eagle-Barrett syndrome as a 'kinder
and more appropriate designation' than prune belly syndrome. Eagle and
Barrett (1950) described 9 cases of congenital deficiency of abdominal
musculature with associated genitourinary abnormalities. They pointed
out that genitourinary symptoms are often not present and that the
obstructive manifestations in the genitourinary tract must be searched
for and corrected at the earliest possible moment. Eagle and Barrett
(1950) stated that 42 cases had been reported before their report of 9
cases. Every case except 1 was in a male.

Smolkin et al. (2008) reported a male infant born with protrusion of
both sides of the abdomen, consistent with prune belly; mild scoliosis,
unilateral auricular sinus, bilateral cryptorchidism with normal-sized
penis, and right-sided congenital hip dislocation were also noted. Chest
x-ray showed multiple segmentation defects, including 11 pairs of ribs,
bilateral cervical ribs, and T8 to T12 and S3 hemivertebrae with
resultant scoliosis. Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated absence of upper
abdominal muscles, liver in the right flank protrusion and both spleen
and bowel in the left flank protrusion; the right kidney was normal, but
the left kidney was absent, and there were normal-appearing
intraabdominal testes. Smolkin et al. (2008) noted that their patient
with prune belly syndrome had 2 previously unreported malformations,
auricular sinus and hemivertebrae, and suggested that on the basis of
the heterogeneous phenotype and the as-yet-unknown etiology, the
designation be changed to 'prune belly association.'

Weber et al. (2005) reported a consanguineous Turkish family in which 3
brothers had posterior urethral valves (PUVs) and 2 other brothers had
PUV in association with prune belly syndrome; 1 of the latter boys died
of urosepsis. The affected sibs had dysfunctional or areflexic bladders
with vesicoureteral reflux and variably decreased glomerular filtration
rates. The most severely affected brother had hydronephrosis, severe
dysplasia of the right kidney, cryptorchidism, and prune belly
abnormalities of the abdominal wall. There was also a sister who had
normal renal function and no urinary tract abnormalities except for
minimal left lower pole calyx hypoplasia. Abdominal ultrasound in both
parents revealed no abnormalities of the kidneys or urinary tract. No
associated extrarenal abnormalities were observed in any of the family
members. Weber et al. (2011) restudied the Turkish family originally
described by Weber et al. (2005), into which a sixth affected brother
with a malformed bladder had been born. Examination of affected
individuals also revealed bilaterally impaired pupillary constriction to
light and dry mouths.

INHERITANCE

Autosomal recessive inheritance is suggested by some reports. For
example, in Lebanon, where the rate of consanguinity is high, Afifi et
al. (1972) described an affected offspring of first-cousin parents.

Garlinger and Ott (1974) described 2 affected brothers in 1 family and 2
affected male cousins in a second, and found 3 other reports of affected
sibs, 2 of affected cousins and 1 of concordant male twins. In the first
family the parents were nonconsanguineous. In the second family the
affected boys' mothers were half sisters; they had different maternal
grandmothers.

Ramasamy et al. (2005) reported 2 brothers with deficient abdominal wall
musculature and bilateral undescended testes, neither of whom had
dilation of the urinary tract. There was no earlier family history of
prune belly syndrome. Ramasamy et al. (2005) reviewed reported cases of
'complete' familial prune belly syndrome, in which the full clinical
triad was present, noting that 28% of patients were female in the
familial form of the syndrome compared to only 5% of nonfamilial cases.
They stated that their findings strongly supported an autosomal
recessive, sex-influenced mode of inheritance.

POPULATION GENETICS

In British Columbia, Baird and MacDonald (1981) found that the incidence
of prune belly syndrome between 1964 and 1978 was 1 in 29,231 live
births.

MAPPING

Weber et al. (2005) performed genomewide linkage analysis in a
consanguineous Turkish family in which 5 brothers had posterior urethral
valve/prune belly syndrome and identified a 35-cM region of homozygosity
on chromosome 1q41-q44, with a maximum multipoint lod score of Z(max) =
3.134 (theta = 0) for the SNPs dbSNP rs158724-dbSNP rs720163. A second
alternative locus was identified on chromosome 11p11 with a lod score of
Z(max) = 3.61 (theta = 0). Equal significance for either locus was
obtained when the affection status of the sibs' sister was set to
'unknown' (lod score of Z(max) = 3.01; theta = 0).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In a consanguineous Turkish family with posterior urethral valve/prune
belly syndrome, previously studied by Weber et al. (2005), Weber et al.
(2011) performed exon capture and massively parallel sequencing and
identified a homozygous frameshift mutation in the CHRM3 gene on
chromosome 1q43 (118494.0001) that segregated with disease and was not
found in 374 Turkish control chromosomes.

A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that
Adams-Oliver syndrome-1 (AOS1) is caused by heterozygous mutation in the
ARHGAP31 gene (610911) on chromosome 3q13.

DESCRIPTION

Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS) is a rare developmental disorder defined by
the combination of aplasia cutis congenita of the scalp vertex and
terminal transverse limb defects (e.g., amputations, syndactyly,
brachydactyly, or oligodactyly). In addition, vascular anomalies such as
cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita, pulmonary hypertension,
portal hypertension, and retinal hypervascularization are recurrently
seen. Congenital heart defects have been estimated to be present in 20%
of AOS patients; reported malformations include ventricular septal
defects, anomalies of the great arteries and their valves, and tetralogy
of Fallot (summary by Stittrich et al., 2014).

- Genetic Heterogeneity of Adams-Oliver Syndrome

Other autosomal dominant forms of Adams-Oliver syndrome include AOS3
(614814), caused by mutation in the RBPJ gene (147183) on chromosome
4p15, and AOS5 (616028), caused by mutation in the NOTCH1 gene (190198)
on chromosome 9q34.

Autosomal recessive forms of Adams-Oliver syndrome include AOS2
(614219), caused by mutation in the DOCK6 gene (614194) on chromosome
19p13.2, and AOS4 (615297), caused by mutation in the EOGT gene (614789)
on chromosome 3p14.

CLINICAL FEATURES

Adams and Oliver (1945) reported a boy with absence of the lower
extremities below the midcalf region, absence of all digits and some of
the metacarpals of the right hand, a denuded ulcerated area on the
vertex of the scalp present at birth, and a bony defect of the skull
underlying the scalp defect. The skin and skull lesions were similar to
those of aplasia cutis congenita (ACC; 107600). The proband had 4
unaffected brothers and a sister and brother with identical defects of
limbs, scalp, and skull. The father was born with absence of toes 2-5 on
the left foot, short terminal phalanges of all fingers, and a scalp
defect. The father was 1 of 10 children, 3 of whom had defects of the
extremities. The father's father was said to have had short fingers.
Whitley and Gorlin (1991) provided a follow-up on the family studied by
Adams and Oliver (1945); the disorder had been transmitted to a member
of a fourth generation. In the intervening 45 years, the original
proband had survived to adulthood and was employed, using orthotic
devices for lower limb defects. He reported good quality of life and no
other medical problems.

Scribanu and Temtamy (1975) described a family with aplasia cutis
congenita with terminal transverse defects of the limbs. The proband was
a 3-year-old boy with striking cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita
(CMTC; 219250). There was variable expressivity and reduced penetrance.

Toriello et al. (1988) described cutis marmorata telangiectatica
congenita in a child with the Adams-Oliver syndrome. He also had
pulmonary hypertension in association with pulmonary vein stenosis and
died at age 4 months of cardiopulmonary arrest. The mother had CMTC
without other features.

Kuster et al. (1988) described 10 individuals with AOS, 7 of them in 2
families and 3 sporadic. The most common features included absence of
middle and distal phalanges, brachydactyly, malformed toes, syndactyly
of the toes, nail dysplasia, hairless scalp patches, and osseous skull
defects. One child had tetralogy of Fallot. The authors identified 11
affected families and 19 sporadic cases that had been reported and found
great variability of limb anomalies, ranging from brachydactyly to
absent lower limbs. The family data suggested autosomal dominant
inheritance.

Santos et al. (1989) reported a girl with scalp ACC and no distal limb
anomalies, who also had aortic coarctation and ventricular septal
defect; her mother had ACC and upper and lower limb reductions, and her
maternal grandmother had typical ACC. The authors suggested that
congenital heart disease could be a component manifestation of AOS.

Jaeggi et al. (1990) reported an affected mother and child as well as a
third sporadic case. Among the 31 reported patients with the full
syndrome, major hemorrhage from the scalp defect occurred in 10, with 2
fatalities. Local infection was noted in 7 babies, with 1 case of fatal
meningitis. Only 30% of the patients had surgical treatment of their
scalp defects by skin grafting.

Whitley and Gorlin (1991) found reports of 81 cases in 32 families with
approximately equal distribution between males and females. The limb
defects were usually asymmetric and ranged from hypoplastic nails to
absence of a hand or foot. Vertical transmission in at least 8 families
was consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance. Despite large
defects of the cranium, the authors stated that central nervous system
abnormalities had not been found in this disorder and intellectual
development appeared to be normal.

David et al. (1991) reported congenital heart disease in association
with the features of Adams-Oliver syndrome. This brought to 6 the number
of cases of such an association. Ishikiriyama et al. (1992) added to the
description of the association and suggested that ventricular septal
defect, including tetralogy of Fallot, may be the predominant type of
congenital heart defect in the Adams-Oliver syndrome.

Fryns et al. (1992) reported a 6-month-old, developmentally retarded
male with a congenital scalp defect associated with a ventricular septal
defect and valvular pulmonary stenosis. Hands and feet were relatively
small with short distal phalanges and small nails of the fifth fingers.
Brain CT scan showed marked cerebellar hypoplasia and vermis agenesis.
They noted that Paltzik and Aiello (1985) had reported scalp defect in
association with ventricular septal defect and pulmonary stenosis.

Dallapiccola et al. (1992) observed aplasia cutis congenita and
coarctation of the aorta in a mother and son. Both had coarctectomy, at
age 14 years and 5 months, respectively. The aortic valve was bicuspid
in the son.

On the basis of a sporadic case in a 10-year-old male, Chitayat et al.
(1992) suggested that acrania is a severe form of aplasia cutis
congenita and is within the spectrum of Adams-Oliver syndrome. In
acrania, the flat bones of the cranial vault are absent, whereas the
bones at the base of the skull are normal.

Farrell et al. (1993) described a sporadic case of AOS in a male infant.
In addition to typical manifestations, he had atrial septal defect,
chylothorax, and chronic juvenile myelogenous leukemia which was
diagnosed at 9 months. Review of the literature (102 cases) showed that
78% of patients had defects of lower limbs and 59% had defects of upper
limbs. To avoid ascertainment bias, Farrell et al. (1993) excluded
propositi for calculations of scalp and skull defects. After this
exclusion, 56% of patients had scalp defects and 21% had skull defects.

Bamforth et al. (1994) reported AOS in a mother and her 3 children with
variable scalp defects and limb defects. Other anomalies included
congenital heart disease, microcephaly, epilepsy, mental retardation,
arhinencephaly, hydrocephaly, anatomic bronchial anomalies, and renal
anomalies. The 3 children were by 2 different fathers.

Zapata et al. (1995) reported 2 patients with Adams-Oliver syndrome and
congenital cardiac malformations. A literature review demonstrated that
13.4% of individuals with this syndrome have congenital heart anomalies.

Pousti and Bartlett (1997) described cutis aplasia congenita in twin
boys born to a mother with a history of cutis aplasia. One of the
infants had associated distal limb anomalies and the other had cardiac
anomalies.

Lin et al. (1998) reported a mother with scalp ACC but normal digits,
who had heart sounds consistent with a bicuspid aortic valve. She had
twin boys with AOS and heart anomalies: the cardiac findings were
consistent with Shone complex in 1 twin and consisted of bicuspid aortic
valve and patent ductus arteriosus in the other. Lin et al. (1998)
reported a second family in which the proband was a 3.5-year-old girl
with AOS and bicuspid aortic valve, whose father had AOS consisting of
ACC and small distal fingertips and fingernails; her sister and paternal
grandfather reportedly also had mild AOS features with ACC and digital
hypoplasia. Lin et al. (1998) reviewed published cases of AOS and stated
that approximately 20% have associated cardiovascular malformations,
frequently involving obstructive lesions on the left side of the heart.

Swartz et al. (1999) reported a 4-year-old girl with AOS who also had
double-outlet right ventricle, pulmonary hypertension, and portal
hypertension resulting from hepatoportal sclerosis.

Keymolen et al. (1999) reported a girl with congenital scalp and acral
reduction limb defects, consistent with the diagnosis of Adams-Oliver
syndrome, who also showed constriction rings, making the limb anomalies
similar to those seen in the amniotic band disruption sequence (217100).
The report was further evidence that the Adams-Oliver syndrome may be a
vascular disruption sequence.

Savarirayan et al. (1999) described a boy with AOS whose sister was also
mildly affected. Their mother had hypoplastic fifth toenails, thought to
represent very mild expression of the syndrome. Computed tomography of
the brain to investigate mild left hemiparesis in the boy demonstrated
severe cortical dysplasia of central, occipital, and anterior regions of
the right cerebral hemisphere. The boy and his sister had apparent
constriction rings present on the toes.

Pereira-da-Silva et al. (2000) described 2 patients with AOS, one of
whom had necrotic lesions of the fingertips, generalized cutis marmorata
telangiectatica, and localized ulceration of the abdominal skin,
indicative of a vascular abnormality.

Patel et al. (2004) described 2 children with AOS and additional
features, including intrauterine growth retardation, CMTC, pulmonary
hypertension, intracranial densities (shown in 1 patient to be sites of
active bleeding), and osteopenia. Patel et al. (2004) concluded that the
2 patients they described, in addition to those reported by Toriello et
al. (1988) and Swartz et al. (1999), established that a subset of AOS
patients is at high risk for pulmonary hypertension.

Maniscalco et al. (2005) reported a father and son with AOS and
pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs). Manifestations of AOS in
this 3-generation family included scalp defect, digital hypoplasia
and/or syndactyly, and cutis marmorata telangiectasia. The authors
suggested that the occurrence of PAVM in AOS supported the hypothesis
that endothelial-specific abnormalities could be the pathophysiologic
mechanism for the development of AOS.

Rodrigues (2007) reported a family in which 4 individuals spanning 4
generations had aplasia cutis congenita and congenital heart lesions. In
addition, affected individuals had craniofacial abnormalities associated
with frontonasal cysts. The proband presented at age 9 days with a
midline frontal cyst between the eyebrows. She also had small C-shaped
ears, prominent nasal bridge, and a V-shaped gingival notch. Other
features included brachydactyly and ventricular septal defect. The
proband's mother and grandmother had similar features and a maternal
grandfather was reportedly affected. None of the affected members had
neurologic or mental impairment.

Snape et al. (2009) described 3 cases of AOS and provided a detailed
review of the available literature, with tabulation of the clinical
features of all reported AOS dominant and recessive families as well as
sporadic patients.

Papadopoulou et al. (2008) reported a 14-month-old boy with aplasia
cutis congenita, distal limb transverse defects, growth retardation, and
a wide atrial septal defect. Central nervous system abnormalities
included central hypotonia, small corpus callosum, and developmental
delay. MRI showed periventricular leukomalacia and enlarged ventricles.
Fetal MRI at 26 weeks' gestation had shown bilateral dilatation of
lateral ventricles and periventricular cysts at the site of the
postnatal lesions, as well as a hypoplastic corpus callosum. The
patient's father and paternal grandfather also had aplasia cutis
congenita without mental defect or other anomalies. The antenatal and
postnatal MRI findings suggested to the authors that this patient's
periventricular leukomalacia may represent an unusual congenital feature
of AOS, possibly due to vascular disruption and decreased perfusion
during critical periods of fetal brain development.

Citing previous studies that have shown the possible association between
ACC of the scalp and various congenital heart defects, including patent
ductus arteriosus (Deeken and Caplan, 1970) and ventricular septal
defect (Dubosson and Schneider, 1978), and noting that such congenital
heart defects occur in approximately 20% of AOS patients (Lin et al.,
1998), Digilio et al. (2008) proposed that variability in clinical
expression of AOS might include the association of congenital heart
defect and ACC without limb defects. Digilio et al. (2008) pointed to
families in which some members exhibit classic AOS and other members
have only ACC and congenital heart defect (Santos et al., 1989; Lin et
al., 1998) to substantiate their hypothesis.

- Reviews

Sybert (1985) and Frieden (1986) provided reviews.

POPULATION GENETICS

Stittrich et al. (2014) stated that the incidence of AOS is
approximately 1 in 225,000 individuals.

INHERITANCE

Bonafede and Beighton (1979) reported a family in which 9 members
spanning 4 generations had congenital scalp defects associated with
abnormalities of the hands and feet. Circumscribed defects of the skull
were an inconsistent finding. Inheritance was clearly autosomal
dominant, with one instance of male-to-male transmission.

Sybert (1989) concluded that ACC in association with limb defects is
most often inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.

PATHOGENESIS

Toriello et al. (1988) suggested that the vascular changes in the skin
may indicate that features of Adams-Oliver syndrome result from vascular
disruption sequences. Jaeggi et al. (1990) also noted that cutis
marmorata and dilated scalp veins in AOS suggested a probable vascular
disruptive pathogenesis.

Der Kaloustian et al. (1991) described 2 families having members
affected with the Poland anomalad (173800) and AOS. They hypothesized
that the Poland anomalad and AOS result from the interruption of early
embryonic blood supply in the subclavian arteries, and that the gene
predisposing to this interruption follows an autosomal dominant pattern
of inheritance. Hoyme et al. (1992) reported that 2 additional
individuals in family 2 of Der Kaloustian et al. (1991) had the Poland
sequence with no findings of Adams-Oliver syndrome.

Swartz et al. (1999) suggested that AOS should be considered not merely
a syndrome consisting of aplasia cutis congenita and terminal transverse
limb defects, but rather a constellation of clinical findings resulting
from an early embryonic vascular abnormality.

Postmortem examination of an AOS patient with pulmonary hypertension
reported by Patel et al. (2004) showed defective vascular smooth muscle
cell/pericyte coverage of the vasculature associated with 2 blood vessel
abnormalities. Pericyte absence correlated with vessel dilatation
whereas hyperproliferation of pericytes correlated with vessel stenosis.
These findings suggested a unifying pathogenic mechanism for the
abnormalities seen in AOS.

Verdyck et al. (2006) reported a Belgian family in which 10 individuals
over 4 generations had Adams-Oliver syndrome, 6 of whom were available
for study. Clinical symptoms were variable, as reported in other
families, and included large areas of alopecia on the vertex of the
skull and serious limb reduction defects with agenesis of all toes of 1
foot.

MAPPING

Southgate et al. (2011) performed a genomewide screen in 22 members of 2
multigenerational families segregating autosomal dominant Adams-Oliver
syndrome, originally reported by Bonafede and Beighton (1979) and
Verdyck et al. (2006), respectively, and identified a locus for the
disease on chromosome 3q13.31-q13.33. Fine mapping defined a 5.53-Mb
critical interval flanked by markers dbSNP rs714697 and D3S4523. A
maximum multipoint lod score of 4.93 was obtained at marker dbSNP
rs1464311.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

In 2 families with congenital scalp defects and distal limb reduction
anomalies mapping to chromosome 3q13, originally reported by Bonafede
and Beighton (1979) and Verdyck et al. (2006), respectively, Southgate
et al. (2011) sequenced 4 candidate genes and identified heterozygosity
for 2 different truncating mutations in the ARHGAP31 gene (610911.0001
and 610911.0002, respectively) that segregated with disease in each
family. Sequencing of ARHGAP31 in 3 additional multiplex AOS kindreds as
well as 43 sporadic patients with features of aplasia cutis congenita
and/or terminal transverse limb defects revealed no mutations.

*FIELD* TX

CLINICAL FEATURES

Acanthosis nigricans consists of thickening and hyperpigmentation of the
skin of the entire body but especially in flexural areas. In an affected
mother and daughter reported by Tasjian and Jarratt (1984), skin lesions
were first noted in infancy.

Chuang et al. (1995) reported familial acanthosis nigricans affecting a
35-year-old woman, her 7-year-old son, and 5-year-old daughter. Absence
of the eyebrows and eyelashes was also present in the affected members
of this family. The mother had no axillary hair and her pubic hair was
sparse. The boy also suffered from congenital heart disease and a
congenital cataract in the left eye. Chuang et al. (1995) suggested that
the combination of acanthosis nigricans and ectodermal defects in this
family may represent a distinct nosologic entity. They referred to the
hair problem as madarosis (loss of the eyebrows or of the eyelashes).

INHERITANCE

In 26 patients with malignant acanthosis nigricans (secondary to
visceral carcinoma), Curth and Aschner (1959) found no other affected
persons in the family. However, they identified families with benign
acanthosis nigricans in successive generations, 3 in 1 family and 2 in 2
others, including instances of male-to-male transmission.

Jung et al. (1965) observed affected mother and daughter.

Lawrence et al. (1971) described a patient with acanthosis nigricans
inherited from the father and telangiectasia (187300) inherited from the
mother.

Using data from 397 participants from 2 Mexican-American family studies,
Burke et al. (2000) investigated the heritability of acanthosis
nigricans and its genetic correlation with other diabetes risk factors.
They examined acanthosis nigricans as both a continuous trait and a
dichotomous trait by means of a previously described validated scale.
The results indicated that the heritability for the condition, when
examined as a continuous trait, was high (0.58 +/- 0.10) and
statistically significant (P less than 0.001). The heritability as a
dichotomous trait was estimated to be moderate (0.23 +/- 0.05) and was
also significant (P = 0.018). The additive genetic correlations between
acanthosis nigricans and type 2 diabetes and its risk factors, including
body mass index and fasting insulin, were high or moderately high and
statistically significant. The random environmental correlations, by
contrast, were low and statistically insignificant. These data suggested
that genes that influence acanthosis nigricans have pleiotropic effects
on diabetes and its risk factors.

In addition to the association with insulin resistance (see 610549),
Seip syndrome (269700), and malignancy, acanthosis nigricans can be
drug-induced; nicotinic acid, diethylstilbestrol, oral contraceptives,
and exogenous glucocorticoids have been incriminated. Clear mendelian
inheritance is seen when acanthosis nigricans is part of syndromes,
e.g., Seip syndrome. Autosomal dominant acanthosis nigricans should be
studied for insulin resistance.

DESCRIPTION

The ALDH1A1 gene encodes a liver cytosolic isoform of acetaldehyde
dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.3), an enzyme involved in the major pathway of
alcohol metabolism after alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH, see 103700). See
also liver mitochondrial ALDH2 (100650), variation in which has been
implicated in different responses to alcohol ingestion.

ALDH1 is associated with a low Km for NAD, a high Km for acetaldehyde,
and is strongly inactivated by disulfiram. ALDH2 is associated with a
high Km for NAD, and low Km for acetaldehyde, and is insensitive to
inhibition by disulfiram (Hsu et al., 1985).

CLONING

Inoue et al. (1979) purified and partially characterized aldehyde
dehydrogenase from human erythrocytes: this was the cytosolic form,
present in only low concentration in red cells. Using isoelectric
focusing, Thomas et al. (1982) showed that the cytosolic and
mitochondrial ALDHs are distinct isozymes. Hempel et al. (1984)
determined the amino acid sequence of the cytosolic ALDH isoform. The
monomer is composed of 500 residues and contains 11 cysteine residues.

Hsu et al. (1985) reported cloning of the ALDH1 and ALDH2 genes. The 2
proteins showed 69% homology at the protein level. The ALDH1 gene
encodes a 501-residue protein (Hsu et al., 1989).

MAPPING

With cDNA probes for Southern blot analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Hsu
et al. (1985, 1986) assigned the ALDH1 locus to chromosome 9q and the
ALDH2 locus to chromosome 12.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hsu et al. (1989) found that the ALDH1 gene is about 53 kb long and is
divided into 13 exons. A similar intron-exon organization was found in
ALDH2, which also has 13 exons with 9 of the 12 introns interrupting the
coding sequence at positions homologous to those in ALDH1. Thus, the 2
isozymes appear to have evolved after duplication of a common ancestral
gene.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Thomas et al. (1982) found low cytosolic ALDH in the liver of alcoholic
patients with fatty liver; mitochondrial ALDH was normal. Abstaining
alcoholics showed persistently low cytosolic ALDH.

Eckey et al. (1986) reported a variant of cytosolic ALDH in a Chinese
autopsy liver specimen. While the major isozyme band was nearly absent,
several additional minor bands were observed on isoelectric focusing
gel. Rabbit antibodies showed immunological cross-reactivity for the
variant enzyme bands. The existence of additional minor bands indicated
the presence of tetramer hybrid forms made up of normal and variant
monomers. The observed abnormality may represent a heterozygous form of
cytosolic ALDH variation. A similar variant was also detected in
erythrocytes of a male Thai student.

Yoshida et al. (1989) demonstrated that among Caucasians alcohol
flushing can be related to abnormalities of ALDH1. In 9 unrelated
Caucasian alcohol flushers, they found 1 who exhibited low activity
(10-20% of normal) and another who exhibited moderately low activity
(60%) and altered kinetic properties. The electrophoretic mobilities of
these 2 samples were not altered. Immunologic quantitation indicated
that the amount of protein in the 2 samples was not reduced in parallel
with the enzyme deficiency. In the first case, the daughter of the
proposita also had very low enzyme activity and alcohol flushing.

ANIMAL MODEL

Retinaldehyde is generated by ADH1 (103700) from retinol, and its
concentration is determined in large part by its subsequent catabolism
by RALDH1 to retinoic acid. Ziouzenkova et al. (2007) demonstrated that
retinaldehyde is present in rodent fat, binds retinol-binding proteins
(CRBP1, 180260; RBP4, 180250), and suppresses PPARG (601487) and
retinoid X receptor (see 180245) responses. Raldh1 -/- mice resisted
diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance and showed increased energy
dissipation. In ob/ob (see 164160) mice, administering retinaldehyde or
a Raldh inhibitor reduced fat and increased insulin sensitivity.
Ziouzenkova et al. (2007) concluded that retinaldehyde is a distinct
transcriptional regulator of the metabolic responses to a high-fat diet.

DESCRIPTION

Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.3) is the next enzyme after alcohol
dehydrogenase (see 103700) in the major pathway of alcohol metabolism.
There are 2 major ALDH isozymes in the liver: cytosolic ALDH1 (ALDH1A1;
100640) and mitochondrial ALDH2.

CLONING

Hsu et al. (1985) isolated partial cDNA clones of ALDH1 and ALDH2 from a
human liver cDNA library. Hsu et al. (1988) isolated and characterized
ALDH2 genomic clones. The deduced ALDH2 protein contains 517 amino
acids, including a 17-amino acid signal peptide.

GENE FUNCTION

Using an unbiased proteomic search, Chen et al. (2008) identified
mitochondrial ALDH2 as an enzyme whose activation correlated with
reduced ischemic heart damage in rodent models. A high-throughput screen
identified a small molecule activator of ALDH2, which they called
Alda-1, that, when administered to rats before an ischemic event,
reduced infarct size by 60%, most likely through its inhibitory effect
on the formation of cytotoxic aldehydes. In vitro, Alda-1 was a
particularly effective activator of ALDH2*2 (100650.0001), an inactive
mutant form of the enzyme that is found in 40% of East Asian
populations. Chen et al. (2008) concluded that the pharmacologic
enhancement of ALDH2 activity may be useful for patients with wildtype
or mutant ALDH2 who are subjected to cardiac ischemia, such as during
coronary bypass surgery.

GENE STRUCTURE

Hsu et al. (1988) determined that the ALDH2 gene contains at least 13
exons and spans approximately 44 kb.

MAPPING

Hsu et al. (1985) assigned the ALDH2 locus to chromosome 12 by means of
a cDNA probe and Southern blot analysis of somatic cell hybrids. With a
cDNA fragment corresponding to the 3-prime coding part of human ALDH1
mRNA, Braun et al. (1986) studied human-rodent somatic cell hybrids and
confirmed the assignment to chromosome 12. The mitochondrial and
cytosolic forms of ALDH are coded by mouse chromosomes 4 and 19,
respectively (Mather and Holmes, 1984). Comparative mapping in man,
mouse, and bovine led Womack (1990) to suggest that ALDH2 is in the
distal part of 12q, distal to IFNG (147570), a conclusion consistent
with other information on the mapping of these 2 loci.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

The ALDH2 alleles encoding the active and inactive subunits are termed
'ALDH2*1' and 'ALDH2*2,' respectively; see 100650.0001. It had been
thought that the 2 alleles were expressed codominantly, and that only
individuals homozygous for ALDH2*2 were ALDH2-deficient. However,
studies of the inheritance of alcohol-induced flushing (610251) in
families suggested that the trait is dominant (Schwitters et al., 1982).

- Early Studies of ALDH Isoforms 

Harada et al. (1980) presented evidence that ALDH is polymorphic in
Japanese. They identified 2 major isozymes: a faster migrating (low Km
for acetaldehyde) and a slower migrating isozyme (high Km for
acetaldehyde). The unusual slower-migrating phenotype, which had less
enzymatic activity, was found in 52% of the specimens; the
fast-migrating isozyme was absent in these specimens. Harada et al.
(1980) postulated that initial intoxicating symptoms after alcohol
drinking in these individuals may be due to delayed oxidation of
acetaldehyde due to variant or absent ALDH. The slow-migrating ALDH
isoform was strongly inactivated by disulfiram, whereas the
faster-migrating isoform was relatively insensitive to disulfiram. These
isoforms were later identified as ALDH1 and ALDH2, respectively.

Agarwal et al. (1981) performed a population genetic study in East
Asians of several different extractions using hair root lysates to
investigate ALDH isozymes. Between 40 and 80% of the several East Asian
groups were found to be deficient in the faster migrating isozyme,
termed ALDH2, whereas not a single European individual was deficient.
The deficiency was invariably associated with sensitivity to alcohol.
Family studies suggested autosomal recessive inheritance of the
deficiency. Harada et al. (1981) found deficiency of the
fast-metabolizing isoform in 43% of Japanese; all deficient persons had
flushing symptoms and, after alcohol drinking, showed an increased mean
acetaldehyde concentration of 37.3 micromoles as compared with 2.1
micromoles in nondeficient persons. Impraim et al. (1982) investigated
the basis of the lack in about 50% of East Asians of 1 of the 2 major
liver ALDH isozymes. Consistent with a convention of nomenclature
adopted by the worldwide workshops, ALDH1 is cytosolic and ALDH2 is
mitochondrial. Impraim et al. (1982) confirmed that it was the ALDH2
isozyme that was missing in persons of Asian descent. The unusual ALDH2
isozyme in Japanese liver was enzymatically inactive but immunologically
cross-reactive. Thus, a structural mutation at the ALDH2 locus was
presumed to be the genetic basis.

Goedde et al. (1983) noted the existence of 4 isozymes of ALDH, which
differed in electrophoretic mobility and isoelectric point. In a
population study, they found that the frequency of deficiency of the
more active isoform was 69% in Indians of the Ecuador Highlands, 44% in
Japanese, and 35% in Chinese. This deficiency was not seen in Egyptians,
Liberians, Kenyans, or Europeans. The authors suggested that deficiency
is related to flushing and a slower metabolism of acetaldehyde, which
could in turn result in a lower frequency of alcoholism and
alcohol-related problems. (Note that the nomenclature used by some of
these authors is confused: ALDH1 is actually ALDH2).

- Molecular Basis

Hsu et al. (1987) developed a method for distinguishing the 2 main
alleles by means of allele-specific 21-base synthetic oligonucleotides.
Using a pair of synthetic oligonucleotides, one complementary to the
ALDH2*1 allele and the other complementary to the ALDH2*2 allele,

Shibuya and Yoshida (1988) determined the genotypes of 49 unrelated
Japanese persons and 12 Caucasians. The frequency of the atypical allele
was found to be 0.35 in the Japanese samples examined. The atypical
allele was not found in the Caucasians.

Crabb et al. (1989) did genotyping on the liver from 24 Japanese
individuals, using the PCR technique for amplification of genomic DNA.
In correlating genotype with phenotype, they found that both
heterozygotes and homozygotes for ALDH2*2 are deficient in ALDH2
activity; that is, the ALDH2*2 allele is dominant. Since ALDH2 is a
homotetrameric enzyme, random association of active and inactive
subunits, equally expressed, should generate about 6% normal tetramers;
the remainder would contain at least 1 mutant subunit. Thus, if all
tetramers containing at least 1 mutant subunit were inactive, there
would be only 6% activity in heterozygotes. This low amount of activity
is likely to be below the detection limit of activity staining of the
gels.

Using allele-specific oligonucleotides for ALDH2*2, Singh et al. (1989)
studied phenotypically deficient individuals in the Chinese, Japanese,
and South Korean families to determine heterozygous or homozygous
status. All individuals with a heterozygous genotype were found to be
deficient, thus demonstrating that only the normal homotetrameric enzyme
is catalytically active.

Oota et al. (2004) used the ALDH2*2 allele, which is responsible for
catalytic deficiency of ALDH2, and 4 noncoding SNPs to study ALDH2
haplotype frequency and linkage disequilibrium in 37 worldwide
populations. Only 4 major SNP-defined haplotypes were found to account
for almost all chromosomes in all populations. A fifth haplotype
harbored the functional variant and was found only in East Asians.

- ALDH2 and Alcoholism

Crabb (1990) pointed out that the single base mutation in ALDH2
responsible for acute alcohol-flushing reaction in Asians, glu504-to-lys
(ALDH2*2; 100650.0001), is the best-characterized genetic factor
influencing alcohol drinking behavior.

Shibuya et al. (1988) studied 23 Japanese with alcoholic liver disease.
No difference was found in the genotypes at the ADH2 (103720) locus;
however, at the ALDH2 locus, 20 of the 23 patients were homozygous for
ALDH2*1, only 3 were heterozygous, and none of the patients was
homozygous for ALDH2*2. The results were interpreted as indicating that
Japanese with the atypical allele are at a much lower risk for alcoholic
liver disease, presumably due to their sensitivity to alcohol
intoxication.

Thomasson et al. (1991) hypothesized that the polymorphisms of both of
the liver enzymes responsible for the oxidative metabolism of ethanol
may modify the predisposition to development of alcoholism (103780).
Using leukocyte DNA amplified by PCR and allele-specific
oligonucleotides in a study of Chinese men living in Taiwan, they
demonstrated that alcoholics had significantly lower frequencies not
only of ALDH2*2 but also of ADH1B*2 (103720.0001) and ADH1C*1 (see
103730.0002). Goedde et al. (1992) gave extensive population frequency
data on ALDH2 as well as on ADH1B. They again showed that the atypical
ALDH2 gene (ALDH2*2) is extremely rare in Caucasians, Blacks, Papua New
Guineans, Australian Aborigines, and Aurocanians (South Chile), but
widely prevalent among East Asians. They cited evidence indicating that
individuals possessing the ALDH2*2 allele show alcohol-related
sensitivity responses such as facial flushing, are usually not habitual
drinkers, and appear to suffer less from alcoholism and alcohol-related
liver disease.

Muramatsu et al. (1995) used the PCR/RFLP method to determine the
genotypes of the ADH2 and ALDH2 loci of alcoholic and nonalcoholic
Chinese living in Shanghai. They found that the alcoholics had
significantly lower frequencies of the ADH2*2 and ALDH2*2 alleles than
did the nonalcoholics, suggesting the inhibitory effects of these
alleles for the development of alcoholism. In the nonalcoholic subjects,
ADH2*2 had little, if any, effect, despite the significant effect of the
ALDH2*2 allele in decreasing the alcohol consumption of the individual.
Taken together, these results were considered consistent with the
proposed hypothesis for the development of alcoholism, i.e., drinking
behavior is greatly influenced by the individual's genotype of
alcohol-metabolizing enzymes and the risk of becoming alcoholic is
proportionate with the ethanol consumption of the individual.

To investigate possible interactions among the variant alleles ADH2*2,
ADH3*1, and ALDH2*2, Chen et al. (1999) genotyped 340 alcoholic and 545
control Han Chinese living in Taiwan at the ADH2, ADH3, and ALDH2 loci.
After the influence of ALDH2*2 was controlled for, multiple logistic
regression analysis indicated that allelic variation at ADH3 exerts no
significant effect on the risk of alcoholism. Any presumed affect could
be accounted for by linkage disequilibrium between ADH3*1 and ADH2*2;
the 2 genes are located on 4q22. ALDH2*2 homozygosity, regardless of the
ADH2 genotype, was fully protective against alcoholism; no individual
showing such homozygosity was found among the alcoholics. Logistic
regression analyses of the remaining 6 combinatorial genotypes of the
polymorphic ADH2 and ALDH2 loci indicated that individuals carrying 1 or
2 copies of ADH2*2 and a single copy of ALDH2*2 had the lowest risk
(odds ratios = 0.04-0.05) for alcoholism, as compared with the ADH2*1/*1
and ALDH2*1/*1 genotypes. The disease risk associated with the
ADH2*2/*2-ALDH2*1/*1 genotype appeared to be about half of that
associated with the ADH2*1/*2-ALDH2*1/*1 genotype. These results
suggested that protection afforded by the ADH2*2 allele may be
independent of that afforded by ALDH2*2.

Chai et al. (2005) examined ADH2, ADH3, and ALDH2 polymorphisms in 72
alcoholic and 38 nonalcoholic healthy Korean men. Forty-eight of the
alcoholic men had Cloninger type 1 and 24 had Cloninger type 2
alcoholism. The frequency of ADH2*1 (103720.0001) and ADH3*2
(103730.0002) alleles was significantly higher in men with type 2
alcoholism than in men with type 1 alcoholism and in healthy men. The
frequency of the ALDH2*1 allele was significantly higher in men with
alcohol dependence than in healthy men. Chai et al. (2005) suggested
that the genetic characteristics of alcohol metabolism in type 1
alcoholism falls between nonalcoholism and type 2 alcoholism.

Luo et al. (2006) genotyped 16 markers within the ADH gene cluster, 4
markers within the ALDH2 gene, and 38 unlinked ancestry-informative
markers in a case-control sample of 801 individuals. Associations
between markers and disease were analyzed by a Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium test, a conventional case-control comparison, a structured
association analysis, and a novel diplotype trend regression (DTR)
analysis. All markers were found to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in
controls, but some markers showed Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium in cases
of alcohol dependence. Genotypes of many markers were associated with
alcohol dependence. DTR analysis showed that the ADH5 (103710) genotypes
and diplotypes of ADH1A (103700), ADH1B (103720), ADH7 (600086), and
ALDH2 were associated with alcohol dependence in European Americans
and/or African Americans. The risk-influencing alleles were fine mapped
from among the markers studied and were found to coincide with some well
known functional variants. They demonstrated that DTR was more powerful
than many other conventional association methods. They also found that
several ADH genes and the ALDH2 gene were susceptibility loci for
alcohol dependence, and the associations were best explained by several
independent risk genes.

Although the ALDH2*2 allele is considered to be a genetic deterrent for
alcoholism, Muramatsu et al. (1996) found that 80 of 655 Japanese
alcoholics had the mutant allele. The authors postulated that these
alcoholics had some other factor that overcame the adverse effects of
acetaldehydemia and that such a factor might reside in the brain's
'reward system,' in which dopamine plays a crucial role. Muramatsu et
al. (1996) studied variation at the DRD4 locus (126452) and found a
higher frequency of a 5-repeat allele of the DRD4 receptor 48-bp repeat
polymorphism in alcoholics with ALDH2*2 than in 100 other alcoholics and
144 controls. They found that alcoholics with the 5-repeat allele also

Kazmierczak et al. (1995) found that the ALDH2 gene was a translocation
partner of the HMGIC gene (HMGA2; 600698) in a uterine leiomyoma. Fusion
genes involving HMGIC are found in pleomorphic adenomas of salivary
glands and in a variety of benign mesenchymal tumors.

ANIMAL MODEL

Using an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO-9) containing the
5-prime-TCCC-3-prime motif, which acts by greatly reducing mRNA levels,
Garver et al. (2001) showed that rat hepatoma cells had reduced Aldh2
mRNA levels and activity, resulting in more than 90% inhibition of Aldh2
synthesis, probably mediated by RNase H hydrolysis. Mismatches in the
TCCC motif, in particular, reduced the efficacy of ASO-9, which
specifically reduced mRNA levels of Aldh2 but not of a control
mitochondrial enzyme, glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUD1; 138130). Treatment
of rats with ASO-9 specifically reduced Aldh2 activity by approximately
40% and increased plasma acetaldehyde levels 4-fold after ethanol
administration. Behavioral analysis indicated that ASO-9 treatment
induced an aversion to ethanol. After initial consumption, a reduction
of 61% in ethanol consumption was observed in treated rats, a level
comparable to that achieved with disulfiram (Antabuse). Garver et al.
(2001) concluded that the specificity and lack of side effects of an ASO
that inhibits ALDH2 expression and mimics the Asian phenotype would be
advantageous when compared with disulfiram.

Nitroglycerin, or glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), elicits nitric oxide
(NO)-based signaling to dilate blood vessels. Chen et al. (2005) found
that mitochondrial bioconversion of GTN to NO was absent in mitochondria
obtained from Aldh2-null mice. Vasoactivity from alternative
nitro(so)vasodilators was unaffected. GTN bioactivity could still be
generated in mutant mice and their isolated vascular tissue, but only at
substantially higher concentrations of GTN. Chen et al. (2005) concluded
that ALDH2 is necessary and sufficient for vasoactivity derived from
therapeutic levels of GTN.

Yao et al. (2010) found that a selective ALDH2 inhibitor (CVT-10216),
suppressed cocaine self-administration in rats and prevented cocaine- or
cue-induced reinstatement in a rat model of cocaine relapse-like
behavior. Inhibition of ALDH2 was found to decrease cocaine-stimulated
dopamine production in neurons in the primary ventral tegmental area by
increasing the formation of tetrahydropapaveroline (THP). THP was found
to selectively inhibit phosphorylated (activated) tyrosine hydroxylase
(TH; 191290), and thus reduce dopamine production via negative feedback.
Yao et al. (2010) concluded that reducing cocaine- and
craving-associated increases in dopamine release appears to be the
mechanism by which ALDH2 inhibition suppresses cocaine-seeking behavior.

Langevin et al. (2011) found that the Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway
counteracts acetaldehyde-induced genotoxicity in mice. Their results
showed that the acetaldehyde-catabolizing enzyme Aldh2 is essential for
the development of Fancd2 (613984)-null embryos. Nevertheless,
acetaldehyde-catabolism-competent mothers (Aldh2 heterozygotes) could
support the development of double-mutant Aldh2-null/Fancd2-null mice.
However, these embryos were unusually sensitive to ethanol exposure in
utero, and ethanol consumption by postnatal double-deficient mice
rapidly precipitated bone marrow failure. Lastly, Aldh2-null/Fancd2-null
mice spontaneously developed acute leukemia. Langevin et al. (2011)
concluded that acetaldehyde-mediated DNA damage may critically
contribute to the genesis of fetal alcohol syndrome in fetuses, as well
to normal development, hematopoietic failure, and cancer predisposition
in Fanconi anemia (see 227650) patients.

Garaycoechea et al. (2012) reported that aged Aldh2-null/Fancd2-null
mutant mice that do not develop leukemia spontaneously develop aplastic
anemia, with the concomitant accumulation of damaged DNA within the
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) pool. Unexpectedly, they
found that only HSPCs, and not more mature blood precursors, require
Aldh2 for protection against acetaldehyde toxicity. Additionally, the
aldehyde-oxidizing activity of HSPCs, as measured by Aldefluor stain, is
due to Aldh2 and correlates with this protection. Finally, there is more
than a 600-fold reduction in the HSC pool of mice deficient in boh
Fanconi anemia pathway-mediated DNA repair and acetaldehyde
detoxification. Therefore, Garaycoechea et al. (2012) concluded that the
emergence of bone marrow failure in Fanconi anemia is probably due to
aldehyde-mediated genotoxicity restricted to the HSPC pool.

ALDH2, GLU504LYS (dbSNP rs671)

The designation for the ALDH2*2 polymorphism has been changed from
GLU487LYS to GLU504LYS. The numbering change includes the N-terminal
mitochondrial leader peptide of 17 amino acids (Li et al., 2006).

The ALDH2*2-encoded protein was first reported to have a change from
glutamic acid (glutamate) to lysine at residue 487 (Yoshida et al.,
1984). Hempel et al. (1985) and Hsu et al. (1985) also showed that the
catalytic deficiency in mitochondrial ALDH in East Asians that manifests
as acute alcohol sensitivity (610251) can be traced to a structural
point mutation at amino acid position 487 of the polypeptide. The
substitution of lysine for glutamic acid results from a G-A transition.

About 50% of East Asians are missing the ALDH2 isozyme. Impraim et al.
(1982) found that the livers of East Asians lacking the ALDH2 isozyme
show an enzymatically inactive but immunologically cross-reactive
material (CRM) corresponding to the ALDH2 isozyme.

To study the mechanism by which the ALDH2*2 allele exerts its dominant
effect in decreasing ALDH2 activity in liver extracts and producing
cutaneous flushing when the subject drinks alcohol, Xiao et al. (1995)
cloned ALDH2*1 cDNA and generated the ALDH2*2 allele by site-directed
mutagenesis. These cDNAs were transduced using retroviral vectors into
HeLa and CV1 cells, which do not express ALDH2. The normal allele
directed synthesis of immunoreactive ALDH2 protein with the expected
isoelectric point and increased aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. The
ALDH2*2 allele directed synthesis of mRNA and immunoreactive protein,
but the protein lacked enzymatic activity. When ALDH2*1-expressing cells
were transduced with ALDH2*2 vectors, both mRNAs were expressed and
immunoreactive proteins with isoelectric points ranging between those of
the 2 gene products were present, indicating that the subunits formed
heteromers. ALDH2 activity in these cells was reduced below that of the
parental ALDH2*1-expressing cells. Thus, the authors concluded that
ALDH2*2 allele is sufficient to cause ALDH2 deficiency in vitro.

Xiao et al. (1996) referred to the ALDH2 enzyme encoded by the ALDH2*1
allele (the wildtype form) as ALDH2E and the enzyme subunit encoded by
ALDH2*2 as ALDH2K. They found that the ALDH2E enzyme was very stable,
with a half-life of at least 22 hours. ALDH2K, on the other hand, had an
enzyme half-life of only 14 hours. In cells expressing both subunits,
most of the subunits assemble as heterotetramers, and these enzymes had
a half-life of 13 hours. Thus, the effect of ALDH2K on enzyme turnover
is dominant. Their studies indicated that ALDH2*2 exerts its dominant
effect both by interfering with the catalytic activity of the enzyme and
by increasing its turnover.

Because genetic epidemiologic studies have suggested a mechanism by
which homozygosity for the ALDH2*2 allele inhibits the development of
alcoholism (103780) in Asians, Peng et al. (1999) recruited 18 adult Han
Chinese men, matched by age, body-mass index, nutritional state, and
homozygosity at the ALDH2 gene loci from a population of 273 men. Six
individuals were chosen for each of the 3 ALDH2 allotypes, i.e., 2
homozygotes and 1 heterozygote. Following a low dose of ethanol,
homozygous ALDH2*2 individuals were found to be strikingly responsive
with pronounced cardiovascular hemodynamic effects as well as subjective
perception of general discomfort for as long as 2 hours following
ingestion.

Among 71 Japanese nondrinkers and 268 drinkers of alcohol, Liu et al.
(2005) found that drinkers had a significantly higher frequency of the
504glu allele. Individuals with the 504lys allele had an increased risk
of alcohol-induced flushing (odds ratio of 33.0).

In a study of 140 men and women of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
heritage, Wall et al. (2000) found that those with ALDH2*2 alleles
experienced more severe hangovers (see 610251) and suggested that this
may contribute, in part, to protection against the development of
excessive or problematic drinking in Asian Americans. Yokoyama et al.
(2005) found that inactive heterozygous ALDH2, alcohol flushing, and
increased mean corpuscular volume (MCV) were positively associated with
hangover susceptibility in Japanese workers, suggesting that
acetaldehyde is etiologically linked to the development of hangover.

In 80 Han Chinese patients with arteriography-confirmed coronary artery
disease who used only sublingual nitroglycerin, or glyceryl trinitrate
(GTN) for angina relief, Li et al. (2006) found that the ALDH2*2 allele
was associated with lack of efficacy of sublingual GTN. Enzyme kinetic
analysis revealed that the catalytic efficiency of GTN metabolism of the
glu504 protein is approximately 10-fold higher than that of the lys504
enzyme. Li et al. (2006) concluded that the presence of the ALDH2*2
allele contributes, in large part, to the lack of an efficacious
clinical response to GTN and recommended that this genetic factor be
considered when administering GTN, particularly to Asian patients, 30 to
50% of whom possess the inactive ALDH2*2 mutant allele.

In a study of 32 adult Han Chinese male students with no personal or
family history of alcoholism, Peng et al. (2007) found that
heterozygosity for the ALDH2*2 allele resulted in higher acetaldehyde
levels after alcohol ingestion compared to wildtype homozygotes. After
ingestion, heterozygotes also had faster heart rates, faster blood flow
in the facial and carotid arteries, and more subjective discomfort
compared to wildtype homozygotes. Overall, the findings indicated that
acetaldehyde, rather than ethanol or acetate, are responsible for
observed alcohol sensitivity reactions. Peng et al. (2007) postulated
that ALDH2*2 heterozygotes have decreased aversion to the adverse
effects of alcohol, and thus increased risk of drinking, compared to
those who are homozygous for ALDH2*2.

Among 1,032 Korean individuals, Kim et al. (2008) found that the
combination of the ADH1B his48 allele (dbSNP rs1229984; 103720.0001) and
the ALDH2 lys504 allele offered protection against alcoholism.
Individuals who carried both susceptibility alleles (arg48 and glu504,
respectively) had a significantly increased risk for alcoholism (OR,
91.43; p = 1.4 x 10(-32)). Individuals with 1 protective and 1
susceptibility allele had a lesser increased risk for alcoholism (OR,
11.40; p = 3.5 x 10(-15)) compared to those with both protective
alleles. Kim et al. (2008) calculated that alcoholism in the Korean
population is 86.5% attributable to the detrimental effect of the ADH1B
arg48 and the ALDH2 glu504 alleles.

In a case-control study with 221 Chinese patients with esophageal cancer
and 191 controls, Ding et al. (2010) found that alcohol drinkers with
the ALDH2 A allele showed a significantly increased risk of esophageal
cancer compared to drinkers with the ALDH2 G/G genotype (OR, 3.08) or
compared to nondrinkers with any genotype (OR, 3.05). There was a
significantly higher risk of esophageal cancer in those with higher
alcohol consumption (OR, 11.93), and a dose-dependent positive effect
was observed. Drinkers with high cumulative lifetime consumption
(greater than 2.5 kg*year calculated as grams of alcohol consumed per
day multiplied by number of years of consumption) carrying both the
ALHD2 A allele and the G allele of ADH1B (his48 allele) had an even
higher risk of esophageal cancer (OR, 53.15) compared to individuals
with the ALDH2 G/G and ADH1B A/A genotypes. Ding et al. (2010)
hypothesized that increased acetaldehyde in drinkers with these
susceptibility alleles has a carcinogenic effect.

See 100640. In stomach tissue, Teng (1981) described an isozymic form of
aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). It did not use formaldehyde,
acetaldehyde, or pyruvic aldehyde. Furfuraldehyde and, to a lesser
extent, propionaldehyde were readily oxidized. Teng (1981) found 1
genetic variant among 71 Chinese stomach specimens and a second
different variant among 33 Asiatic Indian specimens. Unlike liver ALDH,
which appears to be a tetramer, the electrophoretic pattern in the
heterozygotes suggested that stomach ALDH is a monomer. ALDH3 is also
present in lung. By study of somatic cell hybrids, Santisteban et al.
(1985) assigned the ALDH3 gene to chromosome 17.

Using PCR with primers based on conserved regions of aldehyde
dehydrogenases, Hsu et al. (1992) isolated ALDH3 clones from a human
stomach cDNA library. The ALDH3 open reading frame encodes a protein of
453 amino acids. The ALDH3 gene consists of 10 exons spanning
approximately 8 kb. Human ALDH3 protein is 81% identical to that of
ALDH3 from rat hepatocarcinoma cells. By analysis of Northern blots and
PCR products, Hsu et al. (1992) found that ALDH3 is transcribed at high
levels in human stomach and in hepatoma cells, but at very low levels in
normal liver. ALDH3 protein expressed in E. coli exhibited kinetic
properties similar to that of ALDH3 purified from human stomach and
liver.

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

By in situ hybridization, Hiraoka et al. (1995) mapped the ALDH3 gene to
17p11.2. Rogers et al. (1997) found that ALDH3 is 50 to 85 kb from a
closely related gene, ALDH10 (270200), and stated that the close
linkage, sequence similarity (66% identity between the coding sequences,
excluding the final 35 codons unique to ALDH10), and structural
conservation indicate that the 2 genes share a common origin.

Vasiliou et al. (1999) reviewed eukaryotic aldehyde dehydrogenase genes,
tabulated allelic variants in the human, and recommended nomenclature
based on divergent evolution and chromosomal mapping. They considered
ALDH3 a 'trivial' designation and suggested ALDH3A1 as the official
symbol.

ALDH3 constitutes 20 to 40% of the total water-soluble proteins in
mammalian cornea. Kays and Piatigorsky (1997) showed by Northern blot
analysis that ALDH3 expression in the mouse is at least 500-fold higher
in the cornea than in any other tissue examined, with very low levels of
expression detected in stomach, urinary bladder, ocular lens, and lung.
Histochemical localization showed that this exceptional level of
expression in the mouse cornea occurs in the anterior epithelial cells,
and that little ALDH3 is present in the keratocytes or corneal
endothelial cells. As the anterior-most layer of the cornea, the
epithelium is faced with continual impingement by environmental
stressors, such as UV radiation, that can have deleterious effects on
cellular function. The abundant expression of ALDH3 in the corneal
epithelium is believed to play a role in protecting this vital tissue,
as well as the rest of the eye, from damage generated by UV exposure.
With a demonstrated substrate preference for the medium-length aliphatic
aldehyde products of UV-induced lipid peroxidation, ALDH3 is thought to
be responsible for preventing the accumulation of these toxic products
in the cornea. In addition to its detoxification function, ALDH3 may
protect the eye by the direct absorption of UV radiation. The high
UV-absorbing capacity of ALDH3, which is attributed both to its high
tryptophan content and to its ability to bind NAD, led some
investigators to term this major corneal protein 'absorbin.'

Kays and Piatigorsky (1997) showed that a promoter fragment derived from
the mouse ALDH3 gene is capable of targeting expression of the
chloramphenicol acetyltransferease (cat) reporter gene specifically to
the epithelial layer of the cornea in transgenic mice, mimicking the
expression pattern of the endogenous ALDH3 gene. Together with other
results, the experiments indicated that tissue-specific expression of
ALDH3 is determined by positive and negative elements in the 5-prime
flanking region of the gene and suggested putative silencers located in
intron 1.

CLONING

The 2 aldehyde dehydrogenase isozymes that play a major role in ethanol
detoxification, ALDH1 (100640) and ALDH2 (100650), are cytosolic and
mitochondrial forms, respectively. Their organization is basically
similar; their sizes are 53 kb and 44 kb, respectively, and both contain
13 coding exons interrupted by introns of comparable lengths. Hsu et al.
(1989) cloned a novel ALDH gene, ALDH5, from a cosmid human DNA library.
Although it contains no introns, Northern blot hybridization of human
liver RNA revealed a unique mRNA component that hybridized with this
gene probe but with neither the ALDH1 probe or the ALDH2 probe. ALDH5
encodes a deduced 517-amino acid protein that shares 70.6% and 62.8%
sequence identity with the ALDH2 and ALDH1 proteins, respectively.

Hsu and Chang (1991) provided a full report on the ALDH5 gene, which
they referred to as ALDHx.

MAPPING

Hsu et al. (1989) assigned the ALDH5 gene to chromosome 9 by Southern
blot analysis of rodent-human hybrid cell DNAs. By in situ
hybridization, Hiraoka et al. (1995) mapped the ALDH5 gene to 9p13.

*FIELD* TX
Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is extensively conjugated with glucuronic
acid and sulfate before renal excretion. A minor metabolic route
involves microsomal oxidation of acetaminophen to a hepatotoxic reactive
intermediate, which subsequently undergoes glutathione (GSH)
conjugation, yielding cysteine and mercapturate conjugates, both of
which are excreted in the urine (Slattery et al., 1987). Evidence was
presented by de Morais et al. (1989) that, in comparison with normal
subjects, glucuronidation of acetaminophen is impaired in subjects with
Gilbert syndrome (143500), a disorder in which glucuronidation of
bilirubin is impaired. In studies of 125 Caucasian and 33 Oriental
subjects, Patel et al. (1992) found no difference in the mean fraction
of acetaminophen excreted as glucuronide: 51.5% in Caucasians versus
51.8% in Orientals. However, bimodality was apparent in both groups,
with 20% of Caucasians and 33% of Oriental subjects displaying
relatively extensive glucuronidation. In addition, glucuronidation
displayed a strong negative correlation with sulfation (r = -0.97),
suggesting a compensatory or complementary relationship between the 2
metabolic pathways. The mean fractional excretions of cysteine and
mercapturate conjugates between Caucasians and Orientals did show
significant differences (p = less than 0.005).

*FIELD* TX

DESCRIPTION

The ACAT2 gene encodes cytosolic acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (EC 2.3.1.9),
which is important in the utilization of ketone bodies (de Groot et al.,
1977). Mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase is encoded by the ACAT1
gene (607809).

CLONING

Song et al. (1994) cloned an ACAT2 cDNA by use of an antibody against
the human enzyme. The deduced amino acid sequence had 34 to 57% homology
with 4 other human thiolases and 4 acetoacetyl-CoA thiolases of
microorganisms.

MAPPING

The TCP1 gene (186980) is located on 6p in the vicinity of the major
histocompatibility complex, and the murine homolog, Tcp1, is located in
the t-complex region of mouse chromosome 17. In the mouse, a related
gene, Tcp1x, is tightly linked to Tcp1. Ashworth (1993) showed that 2
genes located 3-prime to the murine Tcp1 and Tcp1x genes code for
proteins highly homologous to acetyl-CoA acetyltransferases. These Acat
genes are in opposite orientation to the Tcp1 genes, and transcription
results in mRNA species that contain the last exon of Tcp1 or Tcp1x
within the 3-prime untranslated region of the respective Acat mRNA.
Willison et al. (1987) showed that in humans the TCP1 and ACAT2 genes
also overlap. Retention of this close linkage during mammalian evolution
suggests the possibility of some functional significance. Transcription
of both DNA strands at a given locus is common in prokaryotic and viral
systems. For examples of overlapping transcriptional units in humans,
see Morel et al. (1989) and Laudet et al. (1991).

As the human TCP1 gene had been assigned to 6q25-q27 by study of somatic
cell hybrids and by in situ hybridization, the ACAT2 gene was suspected
to be localized to the same chromosome region. By fluorescence in situ
hybridization, Masuno et al. (1996) demonstrated that the ACAT2 gene is
located on 6q25.3-q26.

ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTOR, MUSCLE, ALPHA SUBUNIT; ACHRA
*FIELD* TX

DESCRIPTION

The acetylcholine receptor of muscle, like the nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor of the Torpedo electric organ, has 5 subunits of 4 different
types: 2 alpha and 1 each of beta, gamma, and delta subunits. In the
electric organ the subunits show conspicuous sequence homology. The
transmembrane topology of the subunits and the location of functionally
important regions, such as the acetylcholine-binding site and the
transmembrane segments involved in the ionic channel, have been
proposed.

CLONING

Noda et al. (1983) cloned cDNA for the alpha subunit precursor of the
calf skeletal muscle AChR and a human genomic DNA segment containing the
CHRNA1 gene. Nucleotide sequences showed marked homology with the
counterpart of Torpedo sp. (electric ray).

Analyzing acetylcholine receptor clones isolated from a human leg muscle
cDNA library, Beeson et al. (1990) found that the alpha subunit exists
in 2 isoforms. A novel 75-nucleotide exon P3A, between exons 3 and 4,
results in the insertion of 25 amino acids into the alpha subunit,
giving the new isoform 462 amino acids. The transcript lacking P3A
(P3A-) encodes a functional subunit, whereas the transcript containing
P3A (P3A+) encodes a nonfunctional subunit. The P3A- and P3A+
transcripts are generated in a 1:1 ratio in human muscle (Masuda et al.,
2008).

Schoepfer et al. (1988) showed that a human medulloblastoma cell line
expressed a muscle type rather than a neuronal type of acetylcholine
receptor. They succeeded in isolating cDNA clones for the alpha subunit
and suggested that these should be useful in obtaining large amounts of
human muscle-type acetylcholine receptor alpha-subunit protein for
studies of the autoimmune response in myasthenia gravis (see 601462).

Keiger et al. (2003) surveyed the developmental expression of nicotinic
receptors, including CHRNA1, in chick and human spinal cord.

GENE STRUCTURE

The protein-coding sequence of the human ACHRA gene is divided into 9
exons that correspond to different structural and functional domains of
the precursor molecule (Noda et al., 1983).

Beeson et al. (1990) identified the exon P3A and found that CHNRA1 gene
is alternatively spliced. Masuda et al. (2008) found that a -8G
nucleotide in intron 3 is an essential nucleotide of an intronic
splicing silencer (ISS) that markedly decreases recognition of exon P3A
by heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H (HNRPH1; 601035).
They showed that hnRNP H is the transfactor that normally binds to this
ISS and suppresses expression of P3A.

MAPPING

By means of somatic cell hybridization, Beeson et al. (1989, 1990)
assigned the CHRNA gene to chromosome 2; by in situ hybridization, they
regionalized the gene to 2q24-q32, with the major peak of grains being
at 2q32. By linkage analysis, Lobos (1993) placed the CHRNA gene about
27 cM proximal to the crystallin G pseudogene marker, CRYGP1, located at
2q33-q35; the CHRND (100720) and CHRNG (100730) loci were placed about
31 cM distal to CRYGP1.

Heidmann et al. (1986) mapped the mouse alpha subunit gene to chromosome
17, but Taylor and Rowe (1989) determined that the mouse Chrna1 gene is
in fact located on chromosome 2.

GENE FUNCTION

Giraud et al. (2007) described a mechanism controlling thymic
transcription of a prototypic tissue-restricted human autoantigen gene,
CHRNA1. This gene encodes the alpha subunit of the muscle acetylcholine
receptor, which is the main target of pathogenic autoantibodies in
autoimmune myasthenia gravis (254200). On resequencing the CHRNA1 gene,
Giraud et al. (2007) identified a functional biallelic variant in the
promoter that was associated with early onset of disease in 2
independent human populations (France and U.K.). The authors showed that
this variant prevented binding of interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF8;
601565) and abrogated CHRNA1 promoter activity in thymic epithelial
cells in vitro. Notably, both the CHRNA1 promoter variant and AIRE
(607358) modulated CHRNA1 mRNA levels in human medullary thymic
epithelial cells ex vivo and also in a transactivation assay. Giraud et
al. (2007) concluded that their findings revealed a critical function of
AIRE and the interferon signaling pathway in regulating quantitative
expression of this autoantigen in the thymus, suggesting that together
they set the threshold for self-tolerance versus autoimmunity.

BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

By recording images at liquid-helium temperatures and applying a
computational method to correct for distortions, Miyazawa et al. (2003)
reported the crystal structure of the acetylcholine receptor of the
Torpedo electric ray at a resolution of 4 angstroms. The pore is shaped
by an inner ring of 5 alpha helices, which curve radially to create a
tapering path for the ions, and an outer ring of 15 alpha helices, which
coil around each other and shield the inner ring from the lipids. The
gate is a constricting hydrophobic girdle at the middle of a lipid
bilayer, formed by weak interactions between neighboring inner helices.
When acetylcholine enters the ligand-binding domain, it triggers
rotations of the protein chains on opposite sides of the entrance to the
pore. These rotations are communicated through the inner helices and
open the pore by breaking the girdle apart.

Lape et al. (2008) investigated partial agonists for 2 members of the
nicotinic superfamily, the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and
the glycine receptor (138491), and found that the open-shut reaction is
similar for both full and partial agonists, but the response to partial
agonists is limited by an earlier conformation change (flipping) that
takes place when the channel is still shut. Lape et al. (2008) suggested
that their observations have implications for the interpretation of
structural studies and for the design of partial agonists for
therapeutic use.

MOLECULAR GENETICS

- Myasthenia Gravis

Garchon et al. (1994) identified 2 stable polymorphic dinucleotide
repeats within the first intron of the CHRNA gene, designated HB and BB.
They found that the HB*14 allele conferred a relative risk for
myasthenia gravis (254200) of 2.5 in 81 unrelated patients compared with
100 control subjects. Very significantly, family analysis based on
haplotype segregation data indicated that parental haplotypes associated
with HB*14 always segregated to the child with myasthenia gravis,
whereas their transmission to unaffected sibs was as expected ('was
equilibrated,' in the words of the authors). Myasthenia gravis patients
always showed a high frequency of microsatellite variants not seen in
controls.

Giraud et al. (2007) found that the minor allele G of dbSNP rs16862847
was associated with early onset of disease in French and U.K. myasthenia
gravis patients in a combined sample of 96 patients in the lower
quartile of the age distribution versus 234 patients in the upper 3
quartiles of the age distribution and 260 controls (odds ratio = 2.19,
95% confidence interval 1.41 to 3.39, P = 0.00048). For heterozygotes
plus homozygotes for the G allele versus homozygotes for the A allele,
the odds ratio for early onset of myasthenia gravis was 2.66 (95%
confidence interval 1.6 to 4.41, P = 0.00015).

- Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes

In a patient with slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome (601462),
Engel et al. (1996) identified a heterozygous mutation in the CHRNA1
gene (100690.0001).

In 2 sibs with fast-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome (608930),
Wang et al. (1999) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in
the CHRNA gene (100690.0007; 100690.0008).

- Lethal Multiple Pterygium Syndrome

Michalk et al. (2008) reported 2 families in which homozygous nonsense
mutations in CHRNA1 (e.g., 100690.0013) caused lethal multiple pterygium
syndrome (253290).

MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, SLOW-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, ASN217LYS 

In a 30-year-old woman with slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome
(601462), Engel et al. (1996) identified a heterozygous 651C-G
transversion in exon 6 of the CHRNA1 gene, resulting in an asn217-to-lys
(N217K) substitution at a conserved residue in the M1 transmembrane
domain. The mutation cosegregated with the disease through 3
generations. Functional expression studies showed that the N217K
mutation slowed the rate of AChR channel closure, increased the apparent
affinity for ACh, and enhanced desensitization. Cationic overload of the
postsynaptic region caused an endplate myopathy.

.0002
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, SLOW-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, VAL156MET 

In a patient with SCCMS (601462), Croxen et al. (1997) identified a
heterozygous 466G-A transition in the CHRNA1 gene, resulting in a
val156-to-met (V156M) substitution in a putative ACh-binding region of
the protein. Functional studies suggested that the V156M mutation
stabilizes the open state of the AChR channel.

.0003
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, SLOW-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, THR254ILE 

In a 60-year-old woman whose myasthenic syndrome (SCCMS; 601462) had
first become symptomatic at the age of 16, Croxen et al. (1997)
identified a heterozygous 761C-T transition in the CHRNA1 gene,
resulting in a thr254-to-ile (T254I) substitution in the M2
transmembrane domain which lines the AChR channel pore. The patient was
previously reported by Chauplannaz and Bady (1994). Functional
expression studies suggested that the T254I mutation stabilized the open
state of the AChR channel.

.0004
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, SLOW-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, GLY153SER 

In 5 members of a family and another unrelated person affected by a
slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome (601462), Sine et al. (1995)
identified a heterozygous 457G-A transition in the CHRNA1 gene,
resulting in a gly153-to-ser (G153S) substitution in the extracellular
domain of the subunit. Electrophysiologic analysis of endplates revealed
prolonged decay of miniature endplate currents and prolonged activation
episodes of single AChR channels. Single-channel kinetic analysis of
engineered alpha-G153S AChR showed a markedly decreased rate of
acetylcholine dissociation, indicating an increased affinity for ACh,
causing the mutant AChR to open repeatedly during ACh occupancy. In
addition, ACh binding measurements combined with the kinetic analysis
indicated increased desensitization of the mutant AChR. Sine et al.
(1995) concluded that ACh binding affinity can dictate the time course
of the synaptic response.

Croxen et al. (1997) identified the G153S mutation in a 41-year-old
woman with SCCMS and her affected mother. Both patients were previously
reported by Chauplannaz and Bady (1994). The G153S substitution resides
in the putative ACh-binding domain of the protein, and functional
expression studies suggested that the G153S mutation impedes
dissociation of ACh from the AChR.

.0005
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, SLOW-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, SER269ILE 

In a 28-year-old woman who first developed symptoms of SCCMS (601462) in
the eighth month of her first pregnancy (Oosterhuis et al., 1987),
Croxen et al. (1997) identified an 806G-T transversion in the CHRNA1
gene, resulting in a ser269-to-ile (S269I) substitution. The mutation
lies within the short extracellular sequence between M2 and M3
transmembrane domains of the protein.

.0006
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, SLOW-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, VAL249PHE 

In a patient with a severe form of SCCMS (601462), Milone et al. (1997)
identified a heterozygous 745G-T transversion in exon 7 of the CHRNA1
gene, resulting in a val249-to-phe (V249F) substitution in the M2
transmembrane domain of the protein that does not face the channel
lumen. The patient's unaffected father was a mosaic for the mutation.
Functional expression studies showed that the V249F mutation causes
increased channel opening in the absence of ACh, prolonged opening in
the presence of ACh, increased affinity for ACh, and enhanced
desensitization. The findings indicated that the structure of the M2
domain is essential for correct stabilization of functional channel
states and that mutation in this region results in multiple functional
defects.

.0007
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, FAST-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, VAL285ILE 

In 2 sibs with fast-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome (608930),
Wang et al. (1999) identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in
the CHRNA gene. The functional mutation was an 853G-A transition in exon
7, resulting in a val285-to-ile (V285I) substitution in the upper third
of the M3 transmembrane domain. The other mutation was a 697T-G
transversion in exon 6, resulting in a phe233-to-val substitution
(F233V; 100690.0008) in the M1 transmembrane domain, causing markedly
reduced protein expression; this was essentially a null mutation.
Functional expression studies showed that the V285I mutation reduced the
amplitude of the miniature endplate current (MEPC), accelerated the
decay of the MEPC, and reduced total current flow through the AChR
channel. Kinetic analysis showed abnormally slow channel opening and
rapid closing, resulting in an abnormally brief current.

.0008

CHRNA1, PHE233VAL 

See 100690.0007 and Wang et al. (1999).

.0009
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, FAST-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, PHE256LEU 

In a patient with fast-channel CMS (608930) originally reported by
Vincent et al. (1981), Webster et al. (2004) identified a heterozygous
766T-C transition in exon 7 of the CHRNA1 gene, resulting in a
phe256-to-leu (F256L) substitution in the M2 transmembrane domain of the
protein. Functional expression studies showed that the F256L mutation
results in fewer and shorter ion channel activations, with a decreased
channel opening rate and an increased channel closing rate. The
patient's mildly affected father also had the F256L mutation. Webster et
al. (2004) noted that autosomal dominant inheritance of fast-channel CMS
is rare.

.0010
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, FAST-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, VAL132LEU 

In a girl with severe fast-channel CMS (608930), Shen et al. (2003)
identified compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the CHRNA1 gene: a
frameshifting null mutation (381delC; 100690.0011), and a 394G-C
transversion, resulting in a val132-to-leu (V132L) substitution, in a
highly conserved cys-loop at the junction between the extracellular
ligand-binding and transmembrane domains of the protein. Functional
kinetic expression studies showed that channels with the V132L mutation
had an increased dissociation constant for ACh, shorter burst duration,
and resistance to desensitization, culminating in a reduced probability
of channel opening over a range of ACh concentrations. The mutant
channel showed an approximately 30-fold decrease of ACh binding affinity
for the second of 2 closed-state binding sites, but only a 2-fold
decrease in gating efficiency. Mutations corresponding to the val132
residue in other AChR subunits showed different effects, indicating
functional asymmetry between cys-loops of the different subunits.

MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, SLOW-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, CYS418TRP  

In a 27-year-old man with congenital slow-channel myasthenic syndrome
(601462) and mild symptoms since birth, Shen et al. (2006) identified a
de novo heterozygous 1362C-G transversion in the CHRNA1 gene, resulting
in a cys418-to-trp (C418W) substitution in the M4 domain of the protein.
This residue is highly conserved across AChR-alpha subunits of different
species but not across individual subunits. Functional kinetic
expression studies in HEK cells showed that the AChR with the mutant
alpha-subunit increased the channel opening equilibrium and the mean
duration of open durations and bursts characteristic of a slow-channel
mutation. The C418W mutant subunit increased the rate of channel opening
and slowed the rate of channel closing, but had no effect on agonist
binding. Shen et al. (2006) used a check plasmid as a screening tool to
identify a specific siRNA that suppressed the mutant, but not the
wildtype allele, at the mRNA, protein, and functional levels in vitro.

.0013
MULTIPLE PTERYGIUM SYNDROME, LETHAL TYPE
CHRNA1, ARG254LEU  

In a consanguineous Pakistani family, Michalk et al. (2008) demonstrated
that multiple pterygium syndrome (253290) was caused by homozygosity for
a G-to-T transversion at nucleotide 761 in exon 6 of the CHRNA1 gene
that resulted in an arg234-to-leu (R234L) substitution in the mature
protein (R254L in the precursor).

.0014
MULTIPLE PTERYGIUM SYNDROME, LETHAL TYPE
CHRNA1, 17-BP DUP, NT117

In a nonconsanguineous African family, Michalk et al. (2008) found that
multiple pterygium syndrome (253290) was caused by homozygous
duplication of 17 basepairs in exon 2 of the CHRNA1 gene, 117-133dup17,
that resulted in frameshift and subsequent premature protein termination
(H24RfsX19; H45RfsX19 in the precursor).

.0015
MYASTHENIC SYNDROME, CONGENITAL, FAST-CHANNEL
CHRNA1, IVS3AS, G-A, -8  

In a woman with autosomal recessive inheritance of fast-channel
congenital myasthenic syndrome (608930), Masuda et al. (2008) identified
compound heterozygosity for 2 mutations in the CHRNA1 gene: a G-to-A
transition in intron 3 (IVS3-8G-A) and a 937C-T transition in exon 7,
resulting in an arg313-to-trp (R313W; 100690.0016) substitution in a
highly conserved residue. Neither mutation was found in 200 control
alleles. Functional expression studies in HEK cells showed decreased
expression of the R313W mutant, which showed mild fast-channel
properties. The -8G-A transition occurred just before exon P3A, and
disrupted an intronic splicing silencer (ISS) sequence, resulting in the
inclusion of exon P3A and yielding a nonfunctional protein.
